# stores-x

This is inspired by Vuex

It's for now a minimal implementation of the vuex

It uses the svelte store

It makes working with svelte stores somewhat clean and organised

Also the compiled version can be used in any other js web app

# installation

`npm install stores-x`

# Also you can try cdn

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/stores-x/dist/index.min.js"><script>
```

for old browsers

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/stores-x/dist/old.index.min.js"><script>
```

module

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/stores-x/dist/index.min.mjs"><script>
```
